## Repository Description

In this project, we will follow the guided project [Introduction to Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel](https://www.coursera.org/projects/introduction-data-analysis-microsoft-excel) on Coursera to do data analysis with Microsoft Excel using sales data from a sample company. We will use sorting and filtering tools to reorganize our data and access specific information about our data. We will also use functions like `IF` and `VLOOKUP` to create new data and relate data from different tables. Finally, we will create pivot tables to summarize and look at comparisons within our data. This website, created from GitHub Pages, will show you a walk-through of this Excel data analysis project.
