    <h4>2. Perform data analysis using sorting and filtering tools</h4>
    In this task, we will start analyzing the data using sorting and filtering tools.
    <h5>Sorting in Excel</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Steps</u>:
        <ol>
            <li>To the right of "Sales Rep" column, click the drop-down arrow.</li>
            <li>Choose [Sort A to Z] to sort it in alphabetical order.</li>

            <li>Choose [Sort Smallest to Largest] to go back to the original data.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h5>Filtering in Excel and Calculating the Total Sales Made by North Division</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Steps</u>:
        <ol>
            <li>To the right of the "Region" column, click the drop-down arrow.</li>
            <li>Uncheck "Select All".</li>
            <li>Check "North".</li>
            <li>Click [Apply].</li>

            <li>Select all the cells in the "Total" column and see the sum at the bottom right corner (i.e. $179,065).</li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/lab-task-02-total-sales-north.png" alt="lab-task-02-total-sales-north.png" width="30%" height="30%">
            <li>To the right of the "Region" column, click the drop-down arrow, check "Select All" and click [Apply] to go back to the original data.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h5>Filtering in Excel and Calculating the Total Sales Made by and the Total Number of Items Sold by a Representative</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Steps</u>:

        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>3. Perform data mining using the IF function</h4>
    In this task, we will learn how to do some data mining using the IF function. The idea behind data mining is that we take the data that we already have, and we create new or additional data from it.
    <h5>Using IF Function to Get Discount Prices</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Steps</u>:
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new column with the header "Discount" to the right of the existing table.</li>
            <li>In the first cell in the new column (i.e. M5), type "<span class="code">=IF(J5>20, "Y", "N")</span>" and press [ENTER].</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The remaining cells of the table will be auto-filled.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>To make it easier to see, highlight the M column and click [Align] under the [Home] tab and [Center].</li>
            <li>Create a new column with the header "Final Price" to the right of the existing table.</li>
            <li>In the first cell in the new column (i.e. N5), type "<span class="code">=IF(J5>20, 0.95*L5, L5)</span>" and press [ENTER].</li>
            <li>To format column N, click the drop-down arrow to the right of [Number Format] under the [Home] tab and choose [Currency].</li>
            <li>Click [Decrease Decimal] twice.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>4. Create references between tables and search for information with VLOOKUP</h4> 
    In this task, we will learn how to relate tables located 
    <h5>Looking Up the Company Name from Customer ID</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Steps</u>:
        <ol>
            <li>To the right of the "Customer ID" column, highlight column G and right-click.</li>
            <li>Choose [Insert Columns] or [Insert 1 Column Left].</li>
            <li>Rename the new column "Company Name".</li>
            <li>In the first cell in the new column (i.e. G5), type "<span class="code">=VLOOKUP(F5, 'Customer Info'!$A$4:$C$12, 2, FALSE)</span>" and press [ENTER].</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>For the first value in the VLOOKUP formula, select cell F5.</li>
                    <li>For the second value in the VLOOKUP formula, click on the "Customer Info" worksheet.</li>
                    <li>For the second value in the VLOOKUP formula, highlight cells A4 to C12.</li>
                    <li>For the second value in the VLOOKUP formula, press [F4] to add "<span class="code">$</span>" in front of the letters and the numbers for our reference cells to anchor these cells so that the range does not change when we apply this formula to the other cells for the other column.</li>
                    <li>For the third value in the VLOOKUP formula, specify the column index number 2 from the reference table for the value we want to return (i.e. "Company Name").</li>
                    <li>For the fourth value in the VLOOKUP formula, type "FALSE" for an exact match.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Press [ENTER].</li>        
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h5>Looking Up the Representative from Customer ID</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Steps</u>:
        <ol>
            <li>To the right of the "Company Name" column, highlight column H and right-click.</li>
            <li>Choose [Insert Columns] or [Insert 1 Column Left].</li>
            <li>Rename the new column "Representative".</li>
            <li>In the first cell in the new column (i.e. H5), type "<span class="code">=VLOOKUP(F5, 'Customer Info'!$A$4:$C$12, 3, FALSE)</span>" and press [ENTER].</li>
            <li>Press [ENTER].</li>

    <h4>5. Perform data analysis using PivotTables</h4>
    In this task, we will learn about another strategy for data analysis which is using Pivot Tables. PivotTables allow us to summarize and analyze the data by seeing comparisons in our data.

    <h2>Graded Assignment Answer Key</h2>
    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: None. All changes are automatically saved while working on Microsoft Excel. 
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: With the online version of Microsoft Excel, any changes made to the file are automatically saved.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: Convert her data into a table and filter the month column to only show the sales from March. 
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: You can filter data in Excel by first converting the data into a table and select the dropdown arrow next to the header to filter the data with respect to a given category.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: <span class="code">=IF(D3>=40,"F","P")</span>
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: The IF function allows us to determine new information from our data. The IF function must include the logical test which is D3>=40, the response if this is true which is "F" for Full-time, and the response if this is false which is "P" for Part-time.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 4</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: <span class="code">=VLOOKUP(D2,$A$2:$B$12,2,FALSE)</span>
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: The VLOOKUP function allows you to search for information relating data located in different tables and even worksheets.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 5</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: The PivotTable would have: Profits as Values, Region as Columns, and Months as Rows.
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: In the PivotTable, the Profits must be in the Values category since they are the numerical component. Then, Region can be positioned as Columns while Months are positioned as Rows or vice versa.
