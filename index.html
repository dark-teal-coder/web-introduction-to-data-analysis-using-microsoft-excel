    <h2>Lab</h2>
    <h3>Lab Instructions</h3>
    <h4>1. Upload a document using the free online version of Microsoft Office 365</h4> 
    In this task, we will learn how to set up a Microsoft Office 365 account, upload a file to our drive, and open the file. We will also learn how to convert the data into a table to aid with the data analysis we will perform in the remaining tasks.

        <u>Steps</u>:
        <ol>
            <li>To the right of "Sales Rep" column, click the drop-down arrow.</li>

            <li>To the right of "Num" column, click the drop-down arrow.</li>
            <li>Choose [Sort Smallest to Largest] to go back to the original data.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h5>Filtering in Excel and Calculating the Total Sales Made by North Division</h5>
    <p>
        <u>Steps</u>:

        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>3. Perform data mining using the IF function</h4>
    In this task, we will learn how to do some data mining using the IF function. The idea behind data mining is that we take the data that we already have, and we create new or additional data from it.
    <h4>4. Create references between tables and search for information with VLOOKUP</h4> 
    In this task, we will learn how to relate tables located 
    <h4>5. Perform data analysis using PivotTables</h4>
    In this task, we will learn about another strategy for data analysis which is using Pivot Tables. PivotTables allow us to summarize and analyze the data by seeing comparisons in our data.

    <h2>Graded Assignment Answer Key</h2>
    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: None. All changes are automatically saved while working on Microsoft Excel. 
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: With the online version of Microsoft Excel, any changes made to the file are automatically saved.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: Convert her data into a table and filter the month column to only show the sales from March. 
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: You can filter data in Excel by first converting the data into a table and select the dropdown arrow next to the header to filter the data with respect to a given category.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: <span class="code">=IF(D3>=40,"F","P")</span>
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: The IF function allows us to determine new information from our data. The IF function must include the logical test which is D3>=40, the response if this is true which is "F" for Full-time, and the response if this is false which is "P" for Part-time.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 4</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: <span class="code">=VLOOKUP(D2,$A$2:$B$12,2,FALSE)</span>
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: The VLOOKUP function allows you to search for information relating data located in different tables and even worksheets.
    </p>
    <h3>Question 5</h3>
    <p>
        <u>Answer</u>: The PivotTable would have: Profits as Values, Region as Columns, and Months as Rows.
        <br>
        <u>Explanation</u>: In the PivotTable, the Profits must be in the Values category since they are the numerical component. Then, Region can be positioned as Columns while Months are positioned as Rows or vice versa.
