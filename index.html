    <h3>About Guided Projects<h3>
    <p>
    In this Guided Project, you will have access to a virtual workspace with all required software pre-installed. You’ll be given video or text-based instructions -- the tasks shared above -- that you can complete in your workspace. After all, we learn best with real-world, hands-on practice.
    </p>
    <h3>Lab Instructions</h3>
    1. Upload a document using the free online version of Microsoft Office 365
    
    In this task, you will learn how to set up a Microsoft Office 365 account, upload a file to your drive, and open the file. You will also learn how to convert the data into a table to aid with the data analysis you will perform in the remaining tasks.
    
    2. Perform data analysis using sorting and filtering tools 
    
    In this task, you will start analyzing the data using sorting and filtering tools.
    
    3. Perform data mining using the IF function
    
    In this task you will learn how to do some data mining using the IF function. The idea behind data mining is that you take the data that you already have, and you create new or additional data from it.
    
    4. Create references between tables and search for information with VLOOKUP
    
    In this task, you will learn how to relate tables located in different tabs, and search for information using the VLOOKUP function.
    
    5. Perform data analysis using PivotTables
    
    In this task, you will learn about another strategy for data analysis which is using Pivot Tables. PivotTables allow you to summarize and analyze the data by seeing comparisons in your data.

    <h2>Graded Assignment</h2>
    <p>
    Question 1: You are working in Excel through free Microsoft Office Online and have just finished inputting the sales data from your company. You wish to save the changes made on your spreadsheet. What steps should you follow?
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the floppy disk icon located in the ribbon.</li>
            <li>Select "File" followed by "Save" in the toolbar.</li>
            <li>Select "Edit" followed by "Save" in the toolbar.</li>
            <li>None. All changes are automatically saved while working on Microsoft Excel.</li>
        </ul>
    Question 2: Sophie is working on sales data from her company and wishes to only see sales from March while hiding the sales from all other months of the year. What steps should she take?
        <ul>
            <li>Convert her data into a table and sort the table by month. Then, delete the sales data from all other months of the year.</li>
            <li>Highlight the data from March and copy it into a new worksheet to create a new table with the March sales data.</li>
            <li>Convert her data into a table and filter the month column to only show the sales from March.</li>
        </ul>
    Question 3: Sophie is working on payroll and has data on the weekly hours for each employee. She wishes to create a new column in her table to classify each employee as F for “Full time” if they worked 40 or more hours, or P for “Part-time” if they worked less than 40 hours. 
    <br>What function would she write for the first cell (E3) of the column?

        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">=IF(D3<40,"F","P")</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">=IF(D3>40,P,F)</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">=IF(D3>=40,"F","P")</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">=IF(D3=40,"F","P")</span></li>
        </ul>
    Question 4: Sophie is working on an order and wishes to calculate the total price for the order. She first needs to look up the prices for each item in the order, given the product name and price data. 
    <br>What function would she write in cell E2 to obtain this information without doing it manually?
    <br><img src="./images/graded-assignment-q4.png" alt="graded-assignment-q4.png" width="50%" height="50%">
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">=VLOOKUP(A2,$A$2:$B$12,3,FALSE)</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">=VLOOKUP(D3,$A$2:$B$12,3,FALSE)</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">=VLOOKUP(E2,$A$1:$C$20,2,FALSE)</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">=VLOOKUP(D2,$A$2:$B$12,2,FALSE)</span></li>
        </ul>
    Question 5: Sophie is working on sales data from her company and wishes to see what the total profits were for each Region, on each month. What PivotTable would she draw? 
        <ul>
            <li>The PivotTable would have: Months as Values, Profits as Columns, and Profits as Rows.</li>
            <li>The PivotTable would have: Profits as Values, Region as Columns, and Months as Rows.</li>
            <li>The PivotTable would have: Region as Values, Months as Columns, and Profits as Rows.</li>
            <li>The PivotTable would have: Region as Values, Profits as Columns, and Months as Rows.</li>
        </ul>
